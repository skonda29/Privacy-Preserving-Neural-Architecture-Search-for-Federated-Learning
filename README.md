## Abstract

Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning approach that allows for collaborative model training while keeping data localized, thus safeguarding privacy. Neural Architecture Search (NAS), on the other hand, automates the design of neural network architectures. When NAS is integrated with FL, several privacy challenges arise. This survey discusses these challenges, reviews existing literature, and provides a comparative analysis of frameworks and techniques to overcome privacy risks in NAS for FL. The paper also suggests future research directions in this emerging field.
